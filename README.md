This repository contains a part of the work made with my colleagues F.P. Fronimos, S.A. Venikoudis and Achilles Gitsis for our work titled: 
"Swampland criteria for rescaled Einstein-Hilbert gravity with string corrections"

Since our work is not published yet but we are the procedure to do so I can only provide the relevant part from the abstract to clarify at least the motivations fo this 
work:

"In this work we examine the Swampland criteria for a specific class of rescaled $f(R)$ gravitational models, that are capable of unifying the primordial era 
of the Universe with the late-time era with the inclusion of string corrections. In particular, we develop separately the theoretical framework of Gauss-Bonnet 
and Chern-Simons theories considering that, the rescale parameter is constrained to reside in the area $0<\alpha<1$. As showcased, in the context of the 
aforementioned theories, a viable inflationary phenomenology consistent with the latest Planck data can be obtained
for both cases for a wide variety of values. The Swampland criteria which where examined are satisfied, not necessarily simultaneously, 
for small values of the rescale parameter, which is in agreement with the case of a canonical scalar field with absent string corrective terms. (...)
Last but not least, the power-law model which is known to be incompatible with observations is now rendered viable by including a parity violating term and as showcased, 
it satisfies the Swampland criteria as well."
